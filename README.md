# ChamberCrawler3000 #

### What is ChamberCrawler3000? ###
CC3K is a project for computer science students developed by A. Roegiest and B. Lushman in 2013. A copy of the original document can be found [here](https://github.com/MitchellTFord/CC3K/blob/master/doc/cc3k%20assignment%20doc.pdf). The gameplay of CC3K is meant to be a recreation of the 1980 game [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)), which in turn is meant to be a digital recreation of [Dungeons and Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons).

### 
The original assignment called for C++ programming and ASCII graphics, but I needed to code in Java and use Swing for graphics.
